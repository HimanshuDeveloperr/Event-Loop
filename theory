to access all the features that are provided by the browser to us we had to make a connection with them 
and that is where comes our web APIs which help us to make connection to the features of the browser so 
we could use them.

some of the web APIs are listed below and these all are not the part of java script

1. set timeout
2. dom apis(ex:- document.querySelector,getelementbyid etc)
3. console
4. location
5. localstorage.
6. fetch().(these help us to make connection with external servers)

so basically our browser gives these web apis to the js engine inside it which we can use in our call stack to access and execute them.
an we can do all of this because of the global object/window

so to access the apis we had to use the keyword window

for ex:=

window.settimeout but as it is present inside the global space 
we can write settimeout to access timer without the window keyword.
