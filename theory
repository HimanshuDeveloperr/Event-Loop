what comes inside  microtask queue?

all the call back functions / functions which comes through 'promises' and mutation observer will go into the microtask queue.

mutation observer will continuously check whether there is a mutation in the dom tree or no and if there is one it will execute a call back function.

callback queue== task queue.

what is starvation ?

if suppose we got a call back function in our microtask queue which creates an multiple callbacks which also pushe in our micro task queue and we already had a pending call back function to be executed inside our callback queue 
but as the js /event loop will give priority to microtask callback functions , the callbacks in our callback queue 
will be postponed till all the call backs in the micritask will be completely executed and this delay of execution of callbacks in callback queue is known as starvation.

simple explanation from google:-

 a problem encountered in concurrent computing where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work.
